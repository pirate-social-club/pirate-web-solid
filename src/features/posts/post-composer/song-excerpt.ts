/** The playback interval of a song-backed video, in integer milliseconds.
 *
 * Under Spec 013 §5A a song-backed video publishes a server-rendered master
 * whose soundtrack is this interval of the canonical song, so the interval is
 * bounded like the video itself and contained within the song. The server
 * accepts 3 to 180 seconds; the owner set new song videos to 3 to 15 seconds on
 * 2026-09-24, so the client never offers more than 15. It is not the Dance segment. Spec 021's scored segment is a separate,
 * opt-in, later-authored 6 to 30 seconds chosen on an already-published video,
 * and publishing an ordinary song-backed video does not create one. This module
 * enforced the Dance limit until 2026-09-10, which conflated the two.
 *
 * These are integers because the server takes them exactly: whole milliseconds
 * at 48 kHz convert to samples without loss. The client's limits mirror the
 * server's policy for feedback only. The server revalidates at reservation,
 * against the canonical song's own duration, and its answer is the authority.
