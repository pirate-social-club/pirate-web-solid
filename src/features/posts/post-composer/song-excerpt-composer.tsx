/** Choosing a real song, hearing the part of it the video will use, and
 * keeping that choice with the video draft.
 *
 * The song is named by an ordinary post link, a `/p/<post id>` link or a bare
 * post id. The audio is the song's full mix through the song playback access
 * operation, which needs nothing from Karaoke: lyrics acceptance, alignment or
 * the Karaoke runtime are not preconditions for posting a video to a song.
 * Whether this audio may be rendered into a published video is the server's
 * decision, asked through the preflight below and decided again at
 * reservation; this surface reports that answer and never infers one.
 *
 * The excerpt is one fixed-length window dragged through the song, and its
 * length is the length of the recording that will carry it. Choosing it is
 * enough: the draft is kept automatically and the server is asked on a debounce
 * rather than on a separate retain action. No fixture is ever substituted
 * here: a song that fails to load says so, in every case.
