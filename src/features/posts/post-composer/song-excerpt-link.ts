/** Turning a pasted song link into the post it names.
 *
 * A link is the temporary way to choose a song, because no catalogue operation
 * exists yet: the community reads expose text and video surfaces and there is
 * no song listing to browse. When one lands, this becomes one of two ways in
 * rather than the only one.
 *
 * A song post's ordinary `/posts/<slug>` link is resolvable through the public
 * post read, which answers with the post id the playback access takes. A
 * `/p/<postId>` link and a bare id resolve directly. Anything else is reported
 * as unsupported rather than guessed at, because guessing would produce a
 * confident failure later.
