/** Aligning a guided take to the song.
 *
 * The encoder starts before the guide is audible, so the captured video's
 * first moments happen before the song does. The server renders the song at
 * video time zero, so those leading milliseconds would appear as the author
 * moving ahead of the music. Measuring the delay is not compensation; the
 * take is trimmed by exactly that delay so its first frame is the first frame
 * after the guide started.
 *
 * Both tracks are kept. The server never maps the captured audio for a
 * song-backed render, but the sealed admission probe still requires a video
 * file with an audio track, so discarding it would make the aligned take
 * unuploadable. The audio is carried through the same trim.
 *
 * The removed duration reported back is measured from the output container,
 * not copied from the request: the number that reaches the plan is evidence.
